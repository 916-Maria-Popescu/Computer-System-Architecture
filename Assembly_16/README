Small assembly language program (x86):
- Read a byte and a word from the keyboard
- Display on the screen if the bits of the byte read
are found consecutively among the bits of the word.
 Example:
 a = 10 = 0000 1010b
 b = 256 = 0000 0001 0000 0000b
The screen will display NO.
 a = 0Ah = 0000 1010b
 b = 6151h = 0110 0001 0101 0001b
The screen will display YES.
