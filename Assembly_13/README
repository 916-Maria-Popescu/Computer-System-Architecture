Small program in Assembly language (x86): 
- Beign given two strings of words, build a new string by the concatination of the higher byte from the fisrt string and the lower byte from  the second string, in ascending order (in the signed representation)
- ex: string1: 1224h, 9800h, 23h, 1h
        string2: 4375h, 1100h, 26h
        the string after the concatination: 12h, 98h, 00h, 00h, 75h, 00h, 26h
